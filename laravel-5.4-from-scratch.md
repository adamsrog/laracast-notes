## Lesson 1 - Laravel Installation and Composer
* Composer is used as the dependency manager for PHP. (https://getcomposer.org)
* PHP package repository available at https://packagist.org
* Be sure to update `PATH` in your shell to make composer accessbile globally.
* `laravel new project` to get started on a new project. Will install all the dependencies.
* `laravel new project --dev` would do the same, but with the development branch.
